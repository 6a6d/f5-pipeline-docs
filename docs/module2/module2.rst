Application Services Extension (AS3)
====================================

Application Services 3 Extension (referred to as AS3_ Extension or more often simply AS3_) is a flexible, low-overhead mechanism for managing application-specific configurations on a BIG-IP system. AS3_ uses a declarative model, meaning you provide a JSON declaration rather than a set of imperative commands. The declaration represents the configuration which AS3_ is responsible for creating on a BIG-IP system. AS3_ is well-defined according to the rules of JSON Schema, and declarations validate according to JSON Schema. AS3_ accepts declaration updates via REST (push), reference (pull), or CLI (flat file editing).
